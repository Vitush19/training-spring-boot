# Online CV project

The goal of this mini-project is to use skills on Spring to make your own online CV website.  
You can either : 
* Make a standalone app using Spring boot + Thymeleaf
* Make a back with an API (using Spring Boot) and a front part to display your data (using Angular)

# Project Conditions
You will develop your project as a **team** of 3.  

In terms of delivery, these are the requirements:
   * Clean & commented code
   * send us a Github or Gitlab link to your repository (don't make it private) 
   * A small ReadMe with instructions to launch your project and a screenshot of your app

Send your repositories at lcouvreux@takima.fr and amoray@takima.fr

# The Project      
Your goal is to create both a client and an administration panel for your own professional website.  
Your website is there to expose your experience and all the info you might want to show on your CV.  
It is aimed at facilitating your presence on the web.

In particular, the following features will be implemented:  

**Admin panel:**
  * Create / edit / delete all sections of your profile: experience, education, skills, hobbies, etc...
  * Edit all profile meta-data: name, email, profile picture, banner, etc...
  * Add optional Social links to your external profiles : LinkedIn, Github, Twitter, Instagram

**Client panel:**
  * Display your CV
  * Allow to contact you through a contact-form

You don't need to implement security like login or user account at the moment.

> You're free to create your models as you wish but it should at least contain : works, education, skills, projects and hobbies. 

# Bonus
All is done on first day?
Here are a few features we as a customer would have loved to have available.
  * Allow to import or export cv-data from / to an external .json file
 * Import data from LinkedIn
 * Implement theme abilities : make someone able to upload a custom theme for his/her CV
 * Implement security (through Oauth: Twitter or Github or LinkedIn)
 * Add a newsletter form and newsletter management in your admin section
 * Make all your sections use Markdown and a nice Markdown editor to format your content
