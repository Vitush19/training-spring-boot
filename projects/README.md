# Projects
This directory contains our sugestions of subjects for your projects. 

You are free to code whatever you want as long as you have a database (mariaDB), spring, a front and the same level of complexity than the other subjects.  

You can either :
  * Make a standalone app using Spring boot + Thymeleaf
  * or, **if you feel confident enough**, a back exposing an API (using Spring Boot) and a front with a Single Page Application (using Angular) 

You will develop your project as a team of 3.

In terms of delivery, these are the requirements:
  * Clean & commented code
  * Send us a Github or Gitlab link to your repository (don't make it private)
  * A small ReadMe with instructions to launch your project and a screenshot of your app

Send your repositories at lcouvreux@takima.fr and amoray@takima.fr
